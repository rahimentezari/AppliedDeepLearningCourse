WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/r/raent/Rahim/NetworkCompression/Single-ModeCompression/Code/Interpretability/LIME/snip-public/snip_3d/model.py:114: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
